How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Californium-Qt` (on Mac)
or `californium252d`/`californium252-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Californium Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Californium Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Californium Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems
using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.14+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Californium
Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as
frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Californium Core on
unsupported systems.

From Californium Core 0.22.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.14 are no
longer supported. Additionally, Californium Core does not yet change appearance
when macOS "dark mode" is activated.

Notable changes
===============

P2P and network changes
-----------------------

Updated RPCs
------------
- `getpeerinfo` no longer returns the following fields: `addnode`, `banscore`,
  and `whitelisted`, which were previously deprecated in 0.21. Instead of
  `addnode`, the `connection_type` field returns manual. Instead of
  `whitelisted`, the `permissions` field indicates if the peer has special
  privileges. The `banscore` field has simply been removed. (#20755)
